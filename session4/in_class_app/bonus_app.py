"""
Sample solution code for the bonus exercises in session 4.

For completeness, the file also include the standard code we covered in class.
This means that to see the bonus exercise solutions working, you only need to run this file
as opposed to `app.py` (also included in this repository in case you want a simpler version
of the app to look at!) which only contains code we covered in class.
